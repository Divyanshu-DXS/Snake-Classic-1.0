# Classic Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The majority of the game logic is contained within the JavaScript file.

## Overview

The game leverages `requestAnimationFrame` to run the game engine loop. This method produces higher quality animation by eliminating flicker and shear that can occur when using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
